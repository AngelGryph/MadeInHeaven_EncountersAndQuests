@0    = ~There's been something killing peoples in and 'round the farms here. Zombies or something. I can understands if you can't stomach the task but, just between you an' me real personal-likes, I don't know who else is gonna do it... All of us haves been goin' for a week now without sleep. We've counted fourty zombies or so, so keep track as you kill 'em, if that's what you plans on doing. Once you got 'em all, come back here and I'll gives you the 150 gold pieces that some of us have pooled together.~
@1    = ~Zombie Infestation
A zombie infestation has been terrorizing the few settlers unlucky enough to own land by the river. An old farmer by the name of Wenric has counted fourty of them and will pay me an impressive 150 gp if I can get rid of every last one.~
@2    = ~Zombie Infestation
A reward of 150 gold pieces for destroying 40 zombies seems a little low. Perhaps I should have bargained.~
